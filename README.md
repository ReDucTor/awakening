# awakening
Repository for the awakening crypto problem.

"asleep()" and "awake()" are encryption / decryption funtions.

The code in "Awakening.py" depicts a terminal session interacting with these functions.

Figure out how to decode the encrypted messages "decode", "decode2" and "decode3".

Submit pull requests of "Requests.py" for any messages you want encoded, and any messages you want decoded (other than the solution), and I will add the results into the file.

Submit pull requests to "README.md" for any questions or clarification.

First person to solve this wins a piece of art!

Enjoy!


Does the order of numbers in the encryption matter / if you moved the items in the dictionary around, would the encryption be different?

Do the quotes get encrypted as well / could you encrypt integers?
